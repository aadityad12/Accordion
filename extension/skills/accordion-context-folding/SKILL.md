description: "Read this skill if you see {#<code> FOLDED} markers in your context (e.g. {#3f9a2c FOLDED}), or if earlier parts of your context look summarized. Accordion is a desktop tool that may compact older context blocks to keep you under a token budget. The unfold tool lets you restore any folded block by its code."

Accordion, an external desktop app, may be folding parts of your context to keep token usage within a budget. This is opt-in and controlled by the human — you cannot disable it, but you can always pull specific blocks back.

## What folding looks like

A folded block appears as:

```
{#3f9a2c FOLDED} Assistant analyzed the test failures: three imports were missing…
```

The `3f9a2c` is a short **fold code** — an opaque handle for that block. The part after `FOLDED}` is a short summary. The original content is preserved and retrievable — nothing is lost.

## Restoring folded content

Call the `unfold` tool with one or more codes copied from the markers:

```
unfold({codes: ["3f9a2c"]})
unfold({codes: ["3f9a2c", "00a2cd"]})
```

(Pass the codes exactly as shown, as strings — a code may have leading zeros.)

The tool returns a confirmation. The restored content appears in your context **on your next turn** — not immediately. If you need the content now, call `unfold` and then take another step (e.g. re-read, continue the task) so the next turn picks it up.

## What to unfold

Only unfold what you genuinely need. Agent unfolds are sticky — the human can see and re-fold them in the GUI, but they will not be auto-refolded while you work. Unfolding costs tokens; if the budget is tight, Accordion may fold other blocks to compensate.

If a block looks irrelevant to your current task, leave it folded. If you need the exact content (code, a specific value, a previous decision), unfold it. If a code matches more than one block (rare), all matching blocks are restored.
