# 🪗 Accordion

### Your agent's memory shouldn't have to forget to keep going.

**See everything your AI agent is holding in context — and fold, unfold, and pin any part of it, by hand or automatically.**

## The problem

Every long-running agent hits the same wall: the context window fills up, and something has to go. Today's answers are both bad — **compaction** blasts your whole history into one lossy summary (slow, destructive, all-or-nothing), and **sliding windows** just drop the oldest tokens (the agent simply forgets). Both treat context as a buffer to flush: the detail is gone, you never saw it go, and you can't get it back.

## The idea

> Context isn't a buffer. It's an accordion.

Accordion shows the agent's context as a list of **sections** — one per turn — and lets you resize it instead of flushing it. Every section is **Full**, **Folded** (shown as a short summary), or **Pinned** (locked open). Four actions move them:

- **Fold** — replace a section with its summary to free up room.
- **Unfold** — bring it back to full detail (still auto-managed, unless pinned).
- **Pin / Unpin** — lock a section open so nothing folds it automatically.
- **Peek** — read a folded section in the window *without* changing the agent's context.

Nothing is ever deleted — folding only changes what the agent is *shown*, never what's *stored* — so every fold is instantly reversible, with no database or search index behind it.

## Three hands on the same controls

- **You** — fold, unfold, pin, and peek, by hand.
- **The agent** — reaches back to unfold or pin context it needs mid-task.
- **The Conductor** — Accordion's automatic mode: between every turn it folds what's gone cold and unfolds what's becoming relevant, on its own.

And folds nest: cold turns fold into **groups**, groups into bigger groups, so a session of thousands of turns stays small enough to fit and complete enough to recover. It all happens in a **separate window** where every change is shown and attributed — open it to watch and steer, close it to let the Conductor run.

## Why it's different

| | Sliding window | `/compact` | Black-box memory | 🪗 Accordion |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Keeps old context usable | ❌ | ⚠️ lossy | ⚠️ if retrieved | ✅ |
| **Reversible** to full detail | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| No mid-task stall | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Per-section, not all-or-nothing | ❌ | ❌ | ⚠️ | ✅ |
| You can see and steer it | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| No extra infra (no vector DB) | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ |

## Status

[VISION.md](VISION.md) is the north star — the finished product we're building toward. What exists **today** is an early proof-of-concept:

- A [pi](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent) extension (`src/accordion.ts`) that automatically folds older turns as context grows and keeps the recent window at full fidelity.
- Reversible folding (originals retained), manual `/expand` and `/collapse`, and an `/accordion` status view.
- Summaries today are deterministic digests, not yet LLM-generated.

Honest about what's **not** there yet: no visual window, no autonomous Conductor, no agent-driven control, no hierarchical folding — that's the build ahead. (The POC is implemented and syntax-checked; it hasn't yet been exercised across a long real session.)

### Try the proof-of-concept

```bash
cp src/accordion.ts ~/.pi/agent/extensions/accordion.ts
pi   # Accordion loads automatically; tune the fold band at the top of the file
```

Commands: `/accordion` (status) · `/expand <n>` · `/collapse <n>`

## Roadmap

- [x] Core fold/unfold engine — reversible, tool-pair safe *(POC)*
- [x] Rolling automatic folding + manual expansion *(POC)*
- [ ] LLM-generated summaries, computed once and cached
- [ ] The separate window — see, steer, replay
- [ ] The Conductor — automatic fold/unfold between turns, based on context
- [ ] Hierarchical folding — fold the folds, for million-turn sessions
- [ ] Agent-driven unfold and pin

**The north star: your agent's memory should be something you can see and steer — not a black box that silently forgets.**
